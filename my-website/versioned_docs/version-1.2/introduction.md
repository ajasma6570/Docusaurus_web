# Introduction version 1.2

The Difuse Project is a next-generation networking and communication solution that empowers small and medium-sized businesses to stay connected, secure, and productive. With its powerful and versatile features, Difuse provides businesses with the tools they need to succeed in today's fast-paced, digital world.

## Connectivity

One of the key benefits of Difuse is its gigabit WAN/LAN connections, which allow businesses to transfer data quickly and reliably. This means that businesses can process large files, download software updates, and stream high-quality video content without experiencing any lag or downtime. Additionally, the two 2.5 Gbps SFP WAN ports provide businesses with more options for connecting to the internet, giving them greater flexibility and redundancy.

Difuse also offers 4G connectivity, which is particularly useful for businesses that need to stay connected while on the go. Whether you're traveling to a client site or working remotely, the built-in 4G modem ensures that you can stay connected to the internet, no matter where you are. This can be particularly useful for businesses that rely on cloud-based software and services, as it allows them to access their data and applications from anywhere.

In addition to its wired connectivity options, Difuse also offers WiFi 6 support, which provides businesses with the latest and most secure wireless technology available. With WiFi 6, businesses can enjoy faster speeds, greater bandwidth, and better security, ensuring that their wireless network is always running smoothly and securely.

## Services

Another key feature of Difuse is its WireGuard VPN support, which provides businesses with a secure and reliable way to connect to their local network from anywhere in the world. Whether you're traveling abroad or working from home, the WireGuard VPN ensures that your data is always encrypted and protected from prying eyes. Additionally, the policy-based routing feature allows businesses to control how their data is routed, giving them greater control over their network.

Difuse also comes pre-installed with IPFS, a decentralized file storage system that allows businesses to share files with other devices on the local and wide-area network. This means that businesses can collaborate more easily, share files more quickly, and improve their overall productivity.

The Difuse Project also includes Asterisk, a powerful open-source PBX (private branch exchange) system that enables businesses to manage their phone systems more efficiently. With Asterisk, businesses can set up their own phone system and take advantage of advanced features like call routing, voicemail, conference calling, and more. The custom GUI (graphical user interface) has been designed specifically for ease of use, making it easy for businesses to configure and manage their phone system without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

By incorporating Asterisk into the Difuse device, businesses can enjoy a complete networking and communication solution that provides them with all the tools they need to stay connected, productive, and efficient. Whether it's managing their phone system or routing data across their network, Difuse provides businesses with the flexibility and control they need to succeed in today's digital world.

Finally, the Difuse device includes a suite of firewall and routing tools, which provide businesses with the tools they need to secure their network and control how their data is routed. With the latest NFTables and associated routing tools, businesses can configure their device to meet their specific needs, ensuring that their network is always running smoothly and securely.

## Conclusion

Overall, the Difuse Project is a comprehensive networking and communication solution that provides small and medium-sized businesses with the tools they need to succeed in today's digital world. With its powerful features and versatile connectivity options, Difuse is the ideal choice for businesses that need to stay connected, productive, and secure.
